# UniEventPro

UniEventPro is an Online Event Management System developed for the 2nd Year 2nd Semester ITP Module by a team of 8 members. The system is built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, ExpressJS, ReactJS, NodeJS) and utilizes TailwindCSS and MaterialUI for styling.

## Responsibilities

As a member of the development team, my primary responsibility was to implement and maintain the **Partner Management** functionality. This involved designing and developing components, forms, views, and database interactions to effectively manage volunteers, sponsors, and speakers for events.

## Partner Management

The Partner Management feature allows organizers to manage volunteers, sponsors, and speakers, while providing volunteers with various opportunities. Here's an overview of the functionality:

<details>
  <summary style="font-size: 18px">Volunteer Management </summary>

- **Read**: View available volunteer opportunities, detailed information about specific opportunities, submitted volunteer forms, application status, and schedule/assignments.

- **Create**: Fill out a registration form to become a volunteer.

- **Update**: Modify volunteer form information.

- **Delete**: Remove volunteer form.

</details>

<details>
  <summary style="font-size: 18px"> Organizer Management </summary>

- **Create**: Add sponsor details using a sponsor form, and add speaker details using a speaker form.

- **Read**: View registered volunteers, speakers, and sponsors, as well as event-specific volunteers in a table view. Generate reports related to partners.

- **Update**: Update sponsor details using an update form, and update the status of volunteer applications in a table.

- **Delete**: Delete partners, such as sponsors and speakers.
